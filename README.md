# Classic Algorithms and Data Structures in C

While studying for interviews I figured it would be good to get my hands dirty with some of the most important algorithms and data structures known to humankind. Having a preference for C, I decided to build everything from the ground up (where the ground includes most of the Standard Libary). 

Ultimately, I have the following goals for this repository:
* Correctly implement a wide variety of canonical algorithms and data structures.
* Make each implementation flexible, so that they can be adapted for multiple uses.
* Have clean, commented code with a consistent style.
* Have a rigorous test suite for each implementation.
* Learn a lot.

As things currently stand, many of the implemenations in the "inprogress" folder are morally correct; however, they are lacking comments and a test suite. I hope to move these to the "complete" folder after adding comments, cleaning up the code, and adding appropriate tests. Since I was initially trying to get through as many of these as possible (notably before making this repo), I suspect that the cleaning up phase may be more work than the original coding phase.
